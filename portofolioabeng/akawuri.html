    <h4>Akarui Jic, あかるい</h4>
    <p7>Akarui Jic is this super cute girl group from our school’s dance club, and they do Japanese dance covers! They actually debuted back in 2023 (fun fact: all the members are RPL students from Asta Arkananta too!!). The first time I ever saw them was during the extracurricular showcase at MPLS. They performed a JKT48 song if I remember correctly — and OMG they were so freaking adorable I couldn’t deal 🥺💕. Honestly, I had zero plans to join Akarui — or even dance club at all, like… nope. But a few months later, my friend (let’s just call her Avrill the cutie), suddenly asked me to try out because Akarui was opening auditions for new members or trainees. At first, I said no 'cause singing was part of the audition and I was like, uhh no thanks 😬 But idk, deep down I felt like... why hide my talent forever?😔. So yeah, I ended up signing up! But here’s the thing — Avrill auditioned before me, so I had to audition alone 😭 It was kinda embarrassing but also super fun at the same time. And it wasn’t just us, some students from another class joined too! That’s basically how I got into Akarui. Wild, right? Never thought I’d join a dance group but here we are.</p7>

    <p8>So far, one of the most exciting things I’ve done with Akarui was performing at Voeltura — it’s like this school birthday event, and guess what? It was also my and Avrill’s debut stage!! 😭✨ Sadly, Lovely couldn’t join that performance because she was one of the event committees (boo... justice for Lovely 😔), but I swear she has to be in the next event. Manifesting that hard 💅. At Voeltura, we performed Seventeen by JKT48 and it was seriously SO CUTEEE. Like, I was living my best life up there. That whole experience is something I’ll literally never forget. I felt so happy, it was unreal 😭💗. Besides that, we haven’t done many events yet, but there was this one time when Lovely and I got invited to watch Akarui perform at an university event — I kinda forgot the name 😅 but BROOO the senior members were so freaking adorable??? Like??? They’re actually too cute to be real. I was dying. Plus, I got to see what they do backstage before going on stage, and it was sooo cool. They’re seriously like the idols of Asta Arkananta. No joke. 👑💖</p8>
