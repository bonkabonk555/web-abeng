    <h5>Commet Asta Arkananta</h5>
    <p9>Jurnalistik Asta Arkananta — or as we call it, Commet — is technically just an extracurricular… but honestly? It doesn’t feel “just” like that at all. I don’t even know why, but this club is so cool, like it’s actually one of the best things I’ve joined. Little backstory: in junior high, I literally didn’t take any extracurriculars seriously — like, they were more of a “just for the formality” thing 😩 but now in vocational school, Commet hits different. Not because it’s perfect or anything, but because the vibe is amazing. There’s no toxic cliques, no weird group drama — we’re all just one big team. Super united, and genuinely fun to be around 🫶. Oh, and of course, our teacher is Pak Feb, the icon himself 😎 I’m part of the design division (slayyy), though sometimes I do narrations too hehe. And get this — the front page photo on our website? We actually took that after our extracurricular demo day. WHICH WAS MY FIRST TIME EVER JOINING AN EXTRACURRICULAR DEMO AHHH 😭💥 Super nerve-wracking, but also kinda awesome ngl.</p9>
